## what are these

## deal_big_json.py
sometimes the source txt maybe too bigï¼Œso I cut it into some small json into a small json directory
but i think you have to deal with the txt by yourself

## wrong_json_identify.py
sometimes there are some decode error  so I filter some of them

## idf_maker
there are two way to compute idf 
one is the traditional type.
one you can is import a special API called rank_bm25

tell me if you have any question
